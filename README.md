<h1>Financial Performance Dashboard</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focused on performing a comprehensive financial diagnostic for a service-based naval company by analyzing data from the last three accounting periods (2021â€“2022, 2022â€“2023, and 2023â€“2024). The goal was to audit financial records and evaluate key liquidity indicators, such as the current ratio and quick ratio to assess the companyâ€™s short-term solvency and financial health.
Interactive dashboards and automated reports were developed in Power BI, using centralized financial data extracted from Google Sheets and Excel. These dashboards provide real-time insights into the companyâ€™s liquidity position, helping stakeholders understand performance trends and identify early warning signs of financial stress.
